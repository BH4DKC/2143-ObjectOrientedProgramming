Model–View–Controller (MVC) is a software architecture,currently considered an architectural pattern used in software engineering. The pattern isolates “domain logic” (the application logic for the user) from input and presentation (GUI), permitting independent development, testing and maintenance of each.”

In MVC Design Pattern, the applicationis divided into three interacting categories known as the Model, the View and the Controller. The pattern aims at separating out the inputs to the application (the Controller part), the business processing logic (the Model part) and the output format logic (the View part).
