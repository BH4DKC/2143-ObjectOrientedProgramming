## ACADEMIC HONESTY STATEMENT

- My signature below constitutes my pledge that all of the coding is my own work, with the exception of those portions which are
properly documented. Properly document code from a public source may be used in an extremely limited fashion for this assignment.

- I understand and accept the following definition of plagiarism:
    1. Plagiarism includes the literal repetition without acknowledgment of the writings of another author. 
All significant phrases, clauses, or passages in this paper which have been taken directly from source 
material have been enclosed in quotation marks and acknowledged in the text itself as well as in the list of 
Works Cited or Bibliography. 
     2. Plagiarism includes borrowing anotherâ€™s ideas and representing them as my own. To paraphrase the thoughts of
another writer without acknowledgment is to plagiarize. Plagiarism also includes inadequate paraphrasing. Paraphrased passages (those
put into my own words) have been properly acknowledged in the text and in the bibliography.
     3. Plagiarism includes using another person or organization to prepare this paper and then submitting it as my own work. I understand what plagiarism is, and I further understand that
if plagiarism is found in my paper, my professor will follow the
procedures on academic dishonesty set forth by Midwestern State University

To be clear: The internet has a ton of code snippets and solutions. Using these are acceptable if:
- You don't cut and paste entire solutions to questions.
- Each and every instance of copy pasted code is cited and subsequently commented to show understanding.
- Ultimately, it is MY decision if you were to liberal with code discovered from internet resources. 
- Lastly, solutions between students found to be too similar is classified as academic dishonesty as well.
