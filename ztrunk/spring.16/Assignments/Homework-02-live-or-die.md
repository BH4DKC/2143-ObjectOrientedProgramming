# Homework 2 - Updating the liveOrDie Method
Due on github by ***Tuesday February 2<sup>nd</sup>*** by class time. 

### Requirements
- Working by yourself, or with at most 2 others, update the `liveOrDie` method so that it can handle x and y coordinates that are on the edges of the 2D array.
- You can use addtional methods if needed, as long as the `liveOrDie` method returns a `0` or a `1` indicating what x,y will be in the next generation.


### Deliverables

- A python file called `game_of_life_lod.py` containing your new method(s).
- This file should be pushed to your github repo. I was supposed to show you, but at this stage I'll be ok with you creating a new file using github itself, and pasting your code into it.
- The file should execute with no errors, however no output is really necessary.
- Every person that worked in a group needs to put thier name in a comment block at the top of `game_of_life_lod.py`.

```python
"""
Program "Game of Life"
Name(s):
  Person 1
  Person 2
"""
```

- The code also needs to be on every group members individual github site. If the code is only on one group members github repo, then that person will get all the credit.
