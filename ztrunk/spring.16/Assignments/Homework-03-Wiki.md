# Homework 3 - Wiki Contribution
Due: 24 Apr by Midnight (Sunday)

### Requirements
- You are going to assist in the creation of an OOP wiki for this course.
- Everyone in class will add a minimum of 1 complete definition to include:
    - definition
    - explanation
    - code examples
- The length of your contribution will depend on the topic you choose, but should be thorough.
- You can add to multiple topics. For example you find a good example for something that's already done, just add it.

### Instructions
- Go here: https://github.com/rugbyprof/2143-ObjectOrientedProgramming/wiki 
- Each topic in red is not started. 
- If you click on a red link, it will attempt to create that page, so just leave the page without saving if you don't add any text.
- When you do add to the wiki, feel free to use content from the web (I know I do) but simply cite your sources! 
- Entries are written in markdown. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) is an overview of markdown.
- [Here](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) is a guide to wiki's on github.
- An example of what I'm looking for can be seen [here](https://github.com/rugbyprof/2143-ObjectOrientedProgramming/wiki/Immutable) already in the wiki.


### Deliverables
- Your content will be added directly to the wiki, changes will be tracked by github, therefore nothing to submit seperately.
